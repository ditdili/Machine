## Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Related Topics, etc.

In this repository I am collecting notebooks on various Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Algorithms related topics.

* [Statistical Terms in Data Science and Regression Metrics](https://github.com/ditdili/Machine_Learning_Algorithms_and_ML_Related_Topics/blob/master/Statistical_Terms_in_Data_Science_and_Regression_Metrics.ipynb)
* [k-NN Nearest Neighbor Classification](https://github.com/ditdili/Machine_Learning_Algorithms/blob/master/kNN_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.ipynb)
* [Titanic Dataset - Data Manipulation for SVC (Currently WIP)](https://github.com/ditdili/Machine_Learning_Algorithms/blob/master/Titanic_Dataset-Data_Manipulation_for_SVC-Git.ipynb)


### Deep Learning

* Basic Example of a Neural Network with Tensorflow and Keras (WIP) - [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ditdili/Machine_Learning-Deep_Learning-and_Related_Topics/blob/master/notebooks/Basic_NN_with_Keras_and_Tensorflow.ipynb)
